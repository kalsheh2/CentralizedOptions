# Centralized Options 

We generalize ideas from [Alshehri et. al., 2017] and conduct numerical experiments on a stylized example and the IEEE 14 bus test system.

The .mat files are data files we call in the Jupyter notebook "Final_Central_Clearing_Tool.ipynb", where the model and some theoretical results are also explained.
